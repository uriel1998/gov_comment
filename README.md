# gov_comment

This script parses the Federal Register page, finds things that are requests for 
comment, gets a human-readable version of the actual issue (I don't consider 
legalese "human-readable") and outputs it both to an RSS feed and to a bot 
Mastodon account. 

You can follow it on [Mastodon](https://faithcollapsing.com/@USGovComment).

BlueSky will be via BridgyFed once it's more than a week old, lol.

The feed that is with the most recent posted is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uriel1998/gov_comment/refs/heads/master/rss_output/gov_rfc_rss.xml) .

A feed with issues where the request for comment ends soon is in the works.

## 1. About

TL;DR: The feds make lots of data available, but actually parsing/skimming it is a pain. 
I won't say that's on *purpose*, but... 

...anyway, this is a small effort to help make clear where your voice is requested and can make a difference.
